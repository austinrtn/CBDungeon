CB Dungeon is a console based dungeon game.  The game contains many enemies with different stats and abilities, along with items such as weapons and potions.
This was my first attempt at creating a game with GUI, so unfortuanlty the code is a little spagetti-ish.  However, I believe this program demenstrates my
understanding of objects and inheritance, which has only becaome greater since I began this project.  The main method is contained within MainFrame.java.
